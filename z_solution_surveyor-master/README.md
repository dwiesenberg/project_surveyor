## Overview

This project tested your skills and understanding of Rails associations and advanced forms. You no doubt had to reach into your new bag of tricks to create your model relationships and set up your forms. The most interesting of these would be nested forms and polymorphic relationships.






## Reviewing Your Solution

While reviewing your code you should ask the following questions:

1. How did you model your schema such that you were able to create different question types?
1. How did you keep these different question types associated with a single survey?
1. How did you handle the difference between multiple choice answers and a number range?
1. Once you have a multiple choice question created, how did you go about deciding if it was radio buttons or checkboxes? How did you represent this in your schema? In your models?
1. How did you store the possible values for a number range? Did you use a mix and max?
1. Did you use any polymorphic relationships?
1. How did you keep track of results?
1. How did you associate those results to a given question?
1. How did you associate those results to a given survey?
1. What effect did your schema and associations have on your ability to compile all results into one view?
1. Depending on your schema and associations, how might your implementation differed if you didn't use polymorphic relationships?
1. What effects would a schema without polymorphic relationships have on compiling survey result data?
